title = "Software component models",
abstract = "Component-based Development (CBD) is an important emerging topic in Software Engineering, promising long sought after benefits like increased reuse, reduced time-to-market and hence software production cost. The cornerstone of a CBD technology is its underlying software component model, which defines components and their composition mechanisms. Current models use objects or architectural units as components. These are not ideal for component reuse or systematic composition. In this paper, we survey and analyze current component models, and classify them into a taxonomy based on commonly accepted desiderata for CBD. For each category in the taxonomy, we describe its key characteristics and evaluate them with respect to these desiderata. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.",

abstract = { This paper describes the Aggregate Remote Memory Copy Interface (ARMCI), a portable high performance remote memory access communication interface, developed oriinally under the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Computational Testing and Simulation Toolkit project and currently used and advanced as a part of the run-time layer of the DOE project, Programming Models for Scalble Parallel Computing. The paper discusses the model, addresses challenges of portable implementations, and demonstrates that ARMCI delivers high performance on a variety of platforms. Special emphasis is placed on the latency hiding mechanisms and ability to optimize noncotiguous data transfers. }
