abstract="The Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer is the world's first system with a peak performance greater than 100 PFlops. In this paper, we provide a detailed introduction to the TaihuLight system. In contrast with other existing heterogeneous supercomputers, which include both CPU processors and PCIe-connected many-core accelerators (NVIDIA GPU or Intel Xeon Phi), the computing power of TaihuLight is provided by a homegrown many-core SW26010 CPU that includes both the management processing elements (MPEs) and computing processing elements (CPEs) in one chip. With 260 processing elements in one CPU, a single SW26010 provides a peak performance of over three TFlops. To alleviate the memory bandwidth bottleneck in most applications, each CPE comes with a scratch pad memory, which serves as a user-controlled cache. To support the parallelization of programs on the new many-core architecture, in addition to the basic C/C++ and Fortran compilers, the system provides a customized Sunway OpenACC tool that supports the OpenACC 2.0 syntax. This paper also reports our preliminary efforts on developing and optimizing applications on the TaihuLight system, focusing on key application domains, such as earth system modeling, ocean surface wave modeling, atomistic simulation, and phase-field simulation.",

abstract = {The OpenACC programming model simplifies the programming for accelerator devices such as GPUs. Its abstract accelerator model defines a least common denominator for accelerator devices, thus it cannot represent architectural specifics of these devices without losing portability. Therefore, this general- purpose approach delivers good performance on average, but it misses optimization opportunities for code generation and execution of specific classes of applications. In this paper, we propose OpenACC extensions to enable efficient code generation and execution of stencil applications by parallel skeleton frameworks such as PSkel. Our results show that our stencil extensions may improve the performance of OpenACC in up to 28{\%} and 45{\%} on GPU and CPU, respectively. Moreover, we show that the work-partitioning mechanism offered by the skeleton framework, which splits the computation across CPU and GPU, may improve even further the performance of the applications in up to 18{\%}.},

abstract = {The large processing requirements of seismic wave propagation simulations make High Performance Computing (HPC) architectures a natural choice for their execution. However, to keep both the current pace of performance improvements and the power consumption under a strict power budget, HPC systems must be more energy efficient than ever. As a response to this need, energy-efficient and low-power processors began to make their way into the market. In this paper we employ a novel low-power processor, the MPPA-256 manycore, to perform seismic wave propagation simulations. It has 256 cores connected by a NoC, no cache-coherence and only a limited amount of on-chip memory. We describe how its particular architectural characteristics influenced our solution for an energy-efficient implementation. As a counterpoint to the low-power MPPA-256 architecture, we employ Xeon Phi, a performance-centric manycore. Although both processors share some architectural similarities, the challenges to implement an efficient seismic wave propagation kernel on these platforms are very different. In this work we compare the performance and energy efficiency of our implementations for these processors to proven and optimized solutions for other hardware platforms such as general-purpose processors and a GPU. Our experimental results show that MPPA-256 has the best energy efficiency, consuming at least 77{\%} less energy than the other evaluated platforms, whereas the performance of our solution for the Xeon Phi is on par with a state-of-the-art solution for GPUs.},
